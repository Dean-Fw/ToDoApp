Adjust date text on task creation, date is too close and out of line with the add a dead line button.

Adjust the text of tasks without secondary text, the text appears too low against the checkbox

BUG: upon creating a new list, previous lists are no longer accessible. Possibly due to 'task.text' changing?? Even upon of latest list the screen is not removed. FIXED WOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Make sure ToDolist screens are being removed on deletion. DONE !!!!!!!!
